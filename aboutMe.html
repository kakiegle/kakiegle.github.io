<p>My name is Kat, my pronouns are they/them, and I am a senior in the second year of the Computer Animation and Web Design (CAWD) program at the Center for Technology in Essex. I joined the CAWD program because it was an opportunity to grow my skills in the field and attending a technical high school before college was something I didnâ€™t want to pass up. I have always been interested in arts and tech, this interest helped me find a passion in computer animation.
  <br>
During my time in the CAWD program, I have been awarded with the Most Outstanding Student award for CAWD 2021. I have also been inducted into the National Technical Honor Society. I am a Champlain bound student and after graduation I plan to continue my studies in Computer Animation at Champlain College's Game Art Program.</p>
